This one was pretty cool, it uses the Rockstar programming language.

To finish this challenge, go to the official Rockstar language page: https://codewithrockstar.com/online

You can try the rockstar editor online!

Paste in the code and you'll get a bunch of ascii -- convert that to text and you get: rrrocknrn0113r

Put it in the standard flag format.

Flag: picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
