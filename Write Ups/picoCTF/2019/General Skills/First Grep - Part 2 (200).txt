In this one -- you have to use the built in terminal that is provided

Use grep again

The flag is in /problems/first-grep--part-ii_3_b4bf3244c2886de1566a28c1b5a465ae/files

But the "files" is a directory -- grep can only look inside files

So:

<COMMAND TO SOLVE> grep picoCTF* /problems/first-grep--part-ii_3_b4bf3244c2886de1566a28c1b5a465ae/files/files*/*

Because inside files is several directorys called file0, file1, file2 etc.

/problems/first-grep--part-ii_3_b4bf3244c2886de1566a28c1b5a465ae/files/file2/file5:picoCTF{grep_r_to_find_this_3675d798}

OR -- You can use grep -r picoCTF /problems/first-grep--part-ii_3_b4bf3244c2886de1566a28c1b5a465ae/files and that would work too

Flag: picoCTF{grep_r_to_find_this_3675d798}
