This one is pretty cool. You have to netcat into a server and it shows you a flag shop
The twist is that when you are buying a knock off flag (option 2 > option 1), you need to enter a large
value to mess with the buffer -- I uses 222222222 and then my balance was really large

I was than able to buy the correct flag 1337 --> Which printed out the pico flag

Flag: picoCTF{m0n3y_bag5_325fcd2e}
