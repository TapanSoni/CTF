This one is pretty cool. In this challenge, you are shown a login portal. You need to login to get the flag.
When you login, it checks if you are the actual admin or not, so user: admin, password: admin won't work
You need to edit the packet for this to work. Use Burp Suite to edit the parameters that are passed through
the login.

Fire up burp suite in Kali Linux
Proxy > Options > Proxy Listeners > Add > Bind to all ports + port # 9091 > OK > Select it so it's checked

Open up firefox
Settings > Preferences > Network Proxy Settings > Manual Proxy Configuration > HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1 > Use this for all
protocols > OK

Now, go to the link: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/37907/

Now, Burp Suite will let you control each step of the HTTP request process. You can see each piece of data
as it passes -- EVEN THE DATA/PARAMS -- THAT IS WHAT WE WANT TO CONTROL

Click Forward until you see the login page in the web browser

Login with a username and password

Click forward in Burp Suite until you see the Params tab as you are logging in (not logging out)

Click on the Params tab

You should see 3 values -- your username, your password, and a False value. Double click on the False value and change
it to True

Then click Forward a bunch of times to log in as admin. You should see the flag there.
