This one is pretty cool. You need to emulate that you're picobrowser.

Go to the Options of the Proxy Tab and scroll down to "Match and Replace" and change one of the User Agent "replace"
options with "picobrowser" without the quotes. Don't forget to enable it.

Now, go back to the webpage, and click "flag" and click on "forward" in Burp.

You should see the flag appear. What you did was tell the webpage that you were picobrowser not, Firefox/IE/Chrome.

Flag: picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_7e9c671a}
