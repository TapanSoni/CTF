In this challenge, you are given a web page with a login portal.

This one uses SQL injection.

Navigate to the login portal and there are many different ways of doing this, but I typed this into the
username box: admin--'SELECT * FROM *

I referenced the SQL injection cheat sheet: https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/sql-injection-cheat-sheet/

Click Enter and you should see the flag there.

Flag: picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_0397f20c}
