This one is pretty cool. You are given a packet capture file
and a RSA private key file. 

The packet capture has encrypted TLS v1.2 data in the packets

You need to use the private key file to decrypt the data

Open the packet capture

Then:

Edit > Preferences > Protocols {Expand that tab} > TLS > 
Click "Edit" next to the RSA Keys List > Click the "+" button > 
Then click the "Key File" tab, then put in the file location
of the private key > Click OK

Now, go back to the packet capture and you should be able to see
the decrypted data.

Click on a TLSv1.2 data packet and then > Analyze > Follow > TLS stream

In the stream window you should see the Pico-Flag and the Flag
