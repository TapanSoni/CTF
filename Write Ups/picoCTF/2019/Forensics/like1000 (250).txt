In this challenge you are given a file called 1000.tar

It's tar'd 1000 times -- damn

You need to uncompress it to find the flag.png picture that has the
flag in it

You could just manually untar it but that's stupid

I wrote a shell script to do it in about 1 minute

#!/bin/bash

for((i = 1000; i >= 1; i--))
do
    sudo tar -xvf "${i}.tar";
done

Make sure to chmod +x this file so it's executable
