In this challenge, you are given a text file with spaces and tabs in it

There are two types of spaces -- standard tab and a unicode space

Create a python program that reads in the file, replaces the standard space -- \0x20 with a binary 1 in bytes and the unicode space
\xe2,\x80,and \x83 as a 0 in bytes.

Then, decode that data to ascii then print it out
