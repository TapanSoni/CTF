cd into the directory problem directory.
You will see three files -- vuln.c, vuln, and flag.txt

Execute vuln with a really long string -- like this: ./vuln "jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj"
The flag will print out.
